What did you hope to learn but did not?:
I hope I could learn some specific modern web design examples, like youtube or reddit.

What did you really enjoy learning about?:
The first half of this course is quite joyful, the course materials and assignments are organized.

What worked well in the course? and how?:
The topic coverage are good, I learned many knowledges.

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?:
Many of the inclass exercises are very confusing at the first glance, that gave me a lot pressure.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of materials, design of inclass exercises, goals of project - and be specific please!:
Provide reading materials for each lectures, because I know someone read documentation about AngularJS then realized it's totally useless, so a readling suggestion will be very helpful.
